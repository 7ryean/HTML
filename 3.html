            >JavaScript</a
          >, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to
          the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often
          just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
          syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
          first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of
          the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use
          it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party
          libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
          execute the code on the user's device. As a multi-paradigm language,
          JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
          structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript
          standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking,
          storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other
          runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. <br /><br />
          JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they
          are now core components of other software systems, most notably
          servers and a variety of applications. Although there are similarities
          between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and
          respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and
          differ greatly in design.
